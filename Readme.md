## General Scope

To analyze certain greenhouse gas (GHG) emission characteristics in the U.S. like total emission quantities, emission composition and emission quantities from different sources, as well as the spatial distributions of emissions using facility reported data.

## Dataset to investigate

#### [EPA Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP) Dataset](https://www.epa.gov/enviro/greenhouse-gas-customized-search)

## Analysis to Do

In the GHGRP dataset, the reported information includes emission quantities, gas type, location of the facilities, etc. With other related data, we can investigate several characteristics of GHG emissions. Also, we can analyze the spatial distribution (e.g., in different states, in different climate zones) of the emissions.
